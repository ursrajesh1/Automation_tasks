# Exercise 1: File System Monitor

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This exercise implements a **file system monitor** in Python that tracks:
- File creation, deletion, and modification events.
- Ignores `.log` files to prevent self-monitoring.
- Logs all detected changes to a file.

This is the foundation of system-level monitoring, later extended in Exercise 2.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Monitors a target directory for:
  - **Created files**
  - **Deleted files**
  - **Modified files**
- Ignores files with `.log` extension.
- Configurable polling interval and monitoring duration.
- Logs events with timestamps.
