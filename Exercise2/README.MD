# Exercise 2: Process & Resource Monitor

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This exercise implements a **system-level monitor** in Python that tracks:
- Whether specified processes are running.
- CPU, Memory, and Disk usage.
- Logs warnings when thresholds are exceeded.

It extends the first exercise by monitoring not just the file system, but also system processes and resources.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Detects if a given process (e.g., `python`, `sshd`) is running.
- Tracks system usage:
  - CPU %
  - Memory %
  - Disk usage %
- Configurable thresholds (default: 80%).
- Logs alerts when resources exceed thresholds.
- Ignores unconfigured resources with an error log.

## ðŸ“Œ Files
- `process_monitor.py` â†’ Main implementation.
- `test_process_monitor.py` â†’ Unit tests using `pytest`.
- `process_monitor.log` â†’ Log file generated at runtime (ignored in git).
